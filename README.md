I used the following to get this project running: 
</br>
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
</br>
[Material-ui](https://next.material-ui.com/)
</br>
**and others:** redux, react-dom, node-sass
</br>

**Heads Up** - While interviewing here, I'm currently working in 2 jobs, therefore I didn't finish with the end result I wanted but that should be enough IMHO :)
</br></br>
Also I worked on the project mostly on the weekend and didn't really want to ask questions on the weekend so I had to go with my gut.

* bonuses: skipped due to lack of time
* Maps: I used google but without api key (not the prettiest but working).
* I would usually try to stick to 1 metod/way of design (mostly the project existing structre)
</br> Here I used mostly scss and styled component (maybe 1-2 inline css, just for sport ;)
* I exported in different ways (all up to date with es6), as the section above, just showing that I know.
* Biggest Challenge I had - starting a react project from scratch, thats a first to me
* store - I saved the main states of categories and locations as arrays, given more time I thought about nesting them in a main object in case we will have other related properties to keep.
* Index file -> Redux,  App -> Material, Route.
* Used vscode and prettify... for the first time - not too shabby.
* there is existing code to add initial data

Things I would've added:
* better validation for fields in forms.
* finish the bonuses
* Adding "back" button - might add it today
* more emphsis on design
* etc..
